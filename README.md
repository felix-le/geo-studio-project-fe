We  designed and developed an interactive dashboard to help area councils and their
communities better understand their energy use and how they can mitigate their greenhouse
gas emissions. Using the most recent data collected by ICECAP (Integrated Community energy &
Climate Action Plans) of the Georgian Bay Biosphere, our dashboard will not only illustrate
project targets, baselines, and types of energy use, it will bring the data life and make it real for
the user.

Userâ€™s will be able to interact easily with graphs, charts, and tables that visually represent energy
use, greenhouse gas emissions and project targets, while being able to compare them with other
regions and filter results by date range, energy source and greenhouse gas emissions. This
dashboard will focus on displaying data accurately and creatively, while remaining simple and
easy to use.
